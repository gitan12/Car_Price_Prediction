## Multiple Linear Regression

Welcome to the Multiple Linear Regression project! This repository contains a detailed Jupyter Notebook and a dataset that demonstrates the process of building a multiple linear regression model.

### Project Overview

Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of simple linear regression that models the relationship between two or more predictor variables and a response variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data. This notebook will guide you through the steps of data preparation, model training, and evaluation using a real-world dataset.

### Data

The dataset used in this project contains information about various features of cars and their selling prices. Here are some key details:

#### Features:

1. **symboling**: An insurance risk rating.
2. **CarName**: The name of the car.
3. **fueltype**: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., petrol, diesel).
4. **aspiration**: The type of aspiration (e.g., turbo, standard).
5. **doornumber**: The number of doors on the car.
6. **carbody**: The body style of the car (e.g., sedan, hatchback).
7. **drivewheel**: The type of drive wheel (e.g., front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive).
8. **enginelocation**: The location of the engine (e.g., front, rear).
9. **wheelbase**: The distance between the front and rear wheels.
10. **carlength**: The length of the car.
11. **carwidth**: The width of the car.
12. **carheight**: The height of the car.
13. **curbweight**: The weight of the car without occupants or baggage.
14. **enginetype**: The type of engine (e.g., DOHC, OHV).
15. **cylindernumber**: The number of cylinders in the engine.
16. **enginesize**: The size of the engine in cubic inches.
17. **fuelsystem**: The type of fuel system (e.g., MPFI, 2BBL).
18. **boreratio**: The ratio of the bore to the stroke in the engine.
19. **stroke**: The length of the piston’s travel in the engine.
20. **compressionratio**: The ratio of the engine’s cylinder volume with the piston at the bottom to the cylinder volume with the piston at the top.
21. **horsepower**: The power output of the car’s engine.
22. **peakrpm**: The engine's peak revolutions per minute.
23. **citympg**: The car’s fuel efficiency in city driving conditions.
24. **highwaympg**: The car’s fuel efficiency in highway driving conditions.
25. **price**: The target variable representing the selling price of the car (in USD).

### Key Features

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Understand the dataset by loading it into a Pandas DataFrame and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. **Data Visualization**: Utilize libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the relationships between variables.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
4. **Model Building**: Implement a multiple linear regression model using Scikit-learn.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
6. **Prediction**: Make predictions using the trained model and visualize the results.

### Technologies and Tools Used
